## Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
 - [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
 - [SharedFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - A SharedFlow is a highly-configurable generalization of StateFlow.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Material Components for Android](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android.
